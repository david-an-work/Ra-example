This is a small example of a survey results app that I made using R Shiny. 
Users can choose from one of the randomly generated datasets, or input their own CSV.
I don't have much experience with R Shiny. I do have experience with coding and R in general, including tidyverse and ggplot.
I used ChatGPT to help me code up the app. I coded up the mock datasets.
